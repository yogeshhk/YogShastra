# YogShastra योगशास्त्र

Notes, for my name's sake!!

Objective is to compile understandings, from readings/watchings done on the topics of Yog, collectively called as Yog-Shastra (Science of Yoga).

Main theme would be YogSutra by Patanjali, a terse, loaded, no nonsense (no spiritual mumbo jumbo, u turns, etc) explanation of Yog

Notes are prepared in both, presentation and course-handouts formats. They are organized into following subtopics:
- Introduction
- Ashtang Yog (8 limbs of Yoga)
- Yog Sutra (Patanjali's Yog Sutra and interpretations)

Wonderful to see one fit and flexible, in those asanas!!

Meditation can not be done. It will happen. Prepare body and breathe-mind.

# What is Yog?
- yuj: to unite: body and mind, atma to paramatma
- Keep it open source, anyone can add, but preserve core essence, spread it free
- Body as onion peels: स्थुल, सूक्श्म, अति सुक्श्म, आत्मा
- dhyan means attention, to thoughts like a witness 
- thoughts come from mind, truth is in no-mind state
